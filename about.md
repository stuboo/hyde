  Hey there! This page is included as an example. Feel free to customize it for your own use upon downloading. Carry on!

I'm a practicing physician currently undergoing subspecialty training in Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery at the University of Louisville in Louisville, Kentucky. To learn more about the subspecialty, I invite you to visit [VoicesForPFD.org](http://www.voicesforpfd.org/) or [AUGS.org](http://augs.org). 

Much of this site reflects my hobbies and interests. Like you, I have hobbies and interests not because I'm good at them, but because they are fun. I love to learn and want to get better, so your feedback is welcomed, but you probably won't find perfection on anything written here. In short...this site and its contents are a toy. 

A playground. 

A sandbox. 

You get the picture.

## This site exists:

1. For the occasional blog post.
2. For sharing and discussing projects I'm working on or considering.
3. For getting better at [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
4. To serve as a landing place for everyone who sees my email address and says, "You have your own domain name?"

Thanks for stopping by!
